## Description

This is a project assignment for my MSU Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp. My task was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. It also features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser.
